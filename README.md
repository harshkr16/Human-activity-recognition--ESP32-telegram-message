Activity detection using RSSI of wifi using ESP32 board
In this project, i have tried to detect the activity like "SITTING", "STANDING" AND "WALKING". i have made my laptop to work as a Transmitter and the esp32 board as a Reciever.
The activity is detected within LOS(Line Of Sight) of Rx and Tx.
The distance maintained between the Rx and Tx is 2m.
After detecting the activity,it will send message to your bot on the Telegram that what activity is being performed.
